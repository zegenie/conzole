Conzole is a web browser console-inspired debugger addon designed to make it easier and more fun to utilize the Godot debugger log.

Features include:
* **Browser-console compatible(*) API:** Instantly familiar syntax for anyone used to web development.
* **Detailed object dumping:** When you want to inspect or look at a variable, log it to the Conzole for a detailed look at its properties
* **Grouped log output:** Extending the browser console grouping API with the ability to colorize and rename groups
* **Log limits per group:** Restrict number of log lines per group so you only get the most recent entries. Super useful for long running tasks such as game loops or timers.
* **6 log levels:** Output logs in any level you want and use the built-in toggler to only show specific log levels
* **Filterable output:** Built-in filtering to quickly find specific log items
